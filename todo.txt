Hello, 

Please find assignment below - 

Using React + Redux create a dummy Instagram home page
The page should show a listing of posts (which are photos).
It should be possible to add/create a post.
Implement a dummy API call that will return the list of posts that can be used to render posts in the UI.
There should be actions on each post possible (like comment, share, save).
Each post can have comments and users should be able to add comments to it.
Users should be able to sign-in/sign-up with their names showing on top of the page.
The design should be responsive.

Once you have completed the assignment, please create a private github repo and then share it on this email.

Regards,

Manu
